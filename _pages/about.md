Hello, and thank you for visiting! I'm Sascha, a PhD student in theoretical physics at the JGU in Mainz. My research focuses on early universe cosmology, including topics like the baryon asymmetry of the universe and dark matter.

This website is a space to share my work, ideas, and contributions to the field of theoretical physics. Here, you'll find an overview of my research projects and publications.

Currently I am a PhD student at the [JGU Mainz](https://www.uni-mainz.de/) in the Group of [Julia Harz](https://www.thep.physik.uni-mainz.de/group-of-julia-harz-2/). I am an associate member of the [Mainz Physics Academy (MPA)](https://www.prisma.uni-mainz.de/mainz-physics-academy/) and part of the [PRISMA+ Cluster of Excellence](https://www.prisma.uni-mainz.de/).

Feel free to explore, connect, and discuss with me!
